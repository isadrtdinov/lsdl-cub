    "# LSDL CUB, Homework 1. Robust fine-tuning of CLIP [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main goal in this home assignment is to implement the [Lipsum-FT](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=2JF8mJRJ7M&name=pdf) method for robust fine-tuning of CLIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the same dataset, [DomainNet](https://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/) (also can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wltjr1007/DomainNet)), as in the original paper. Use the **Real** domain as in-distribution (ID) data and the rest of domains as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Use the **Real** train split for training and test splits for evaluation on all of the domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If training takes too much time, you may select a subset (i.e., 50% or 33%) of training data instead of the full split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ViT-B/16` backbone is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to **pass the assignment**, you need to plot a Pareto front (i.e., ID-OOD plot like Figure 1 from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01903)). We will be using 5 OOD domains, so you need to plot 5 Pareto fronts, one for each distribution shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may use any code from the [seminar](https://github.com/isadrtdinov/lsdl-cub/tree/main/week01-finetune/seminar). Also, you may code your training pipelines either in pure PyTorch or combinine it with [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) libraries. Additionally, you may find [`clip`](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and [`wise-ft`](https://github.com/mlfoundations/wise-ft) repos useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not use the implemention from the authors or any publicly available implementations of this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It will be much easier to check your assigment if you maintain a clear code structure (e.g., put different blocks of code into separate files, add necessary coments, etc)."
